## Simple sorts

	* which algorithm did you find easiest to understand?
	- I found bubble sort easiest to understand because I find it the easiest in syntax as well as logic.
	We are comparing two elements side by side and swapping them. This way we will get the largest element gone to the end. Thren we can run it again but this time one less time (because he last element is sorted i.e. is the biggest). Thos way we can get the array sorted.
	*  which algorithm seemed to fastest for completing the sort?
	- I think that insertion sort was the fastest because it didn't have to go through all the steps as others. This is also a more efficent way when running code to get the better possible answer, especially for dealing with larger data files or future labs. 
	Since there are mostly likley a high number of swaps, it's expected to generate twice as many write operations 
	with bubble sort compared to insertion sorts. Therefore, we may prefer an insertion sort for an algorithm with 
	an ordinary sorting job along with efficiency for cost operations.

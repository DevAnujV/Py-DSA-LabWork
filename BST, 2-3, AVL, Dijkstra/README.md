## Objective:

- Learn the algorithms for insertion/deletion from BST
- Learn the algorithm for insertion into AVL tree 
- Learn the algorithm for insertion into Red-black tree (optional)
- Learn the algorithm for insertion into a 2-3 tree
- Learn the algorithm for Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm


## Part A: BST Insert

As a group review bst insertion algorithm.

* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes
* Follow the regular BST algorithm and insert the 15 numbers of your sticky notes into a BST, 
* When completed, take one photo of the final tree


Answer this question.

* What is the height of your final tree?


## PART B: BST Deletion

As a group review BST deletion algorithm

* Find a node in your tree with 2 children and remove that node.
	* Take a picture of tree
* find another node with 2 children and remove that node
	* Take picture of tree

* remove the root node of the tree
	* take picture of tree

Answer this question:

* Anytime you remove a node with 2 children, you need to find a node to take over for node being removed.  Explain how you found your replacement.


## Part C AVL


As a group review AVL insertion algorithm.

* place all your stickynotes randomly into a row.
* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes
* You will need to track the number of times you do a single rotation and double rotation
* Follow the AVL algorithm and insert the 15 numbers of your sticky notes into a BST, 
* When completed, take one photo of the final tree

Answer these questions. 
* How many times you had to do a single rotation?
* How many times you had to do a double rotation?
* How tall is your final tree?

## Part D Red-black trees (optional)

As a group review Red-black tree insertion algorithm

* place all your stickynotes randomly into a row.
* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes
* You will need to track the number of times you do a colour swap, zig-zig rotation and zig-zag rotation
* Follow the red-black tree algorithm and insert the 15 numbers of your sticky notes into a BST, 
* When completed, take one photo of the final tree

## Part E 2-3 trees

As a group review 2-3 tree insertion algorithm

* place all your stickynotes randomly into a row.
* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes
* You will need to track the number of times you do a node split
* Follow the 2-3 tree algorithm and insert the 15 numbers of your sticky notes into a 2-3 tree
* When completed, take one photo of the final tree

## Part F Dijkstra's Algorithm

As a group review Dijkstra's Algorithm

Below is a graph:

Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance from vertex A to every other vertex.  

Show your work by creating a table to track your results.  When completed, fill in the second table with the final result which includes the distance and the full path from A to its destination.
